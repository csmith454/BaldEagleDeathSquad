# The Hive

The Hive is a roguelike-inspired game, where the main character traverses through a factory while defeating evolving zombies and gaining power-ups.  There are three tiers of power-ups: a starting offensive weapon selected before the first level, a passive ability selected before the second level, and a powerful offensive weapon selected before the third level.  

Defeat all the zombies of the hive in each level to progress to the next one and try to make your way through all three levels!

Controls:
  Mouse and Keyboard are recommended.
  Use WASD to move
  Use your Mouse to direct attacks and Left Mouse Button to execute attacks
  '1' and '2' control your offensive capabilities, while 'Spacebar' controls your passive ability

From the main menu, you will have the ability to mute sound, access a controls panel, check out the high score table, and begin your run!
